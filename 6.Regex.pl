#The basic method for applying a regular expression is to use the pattern binding operators =~ and !~.
#The first operator is a test and assignment operator.
#There are three regular expression operators within Perl.
#1. Match Regular Expression - m//
#2. Substitute Regular Expression - s///
#3. Transliterate Regular Expression - tr///
#The forward slashes in each case act as delimiters for the regular expression (regex) that you are specifying.
#If you are comfortable with any other delimiter, then you can use in place of forward slash.

######################More Complex Regular Expressions#########################################################
#You don't just have to match on fixed strings. 
#In fact, you can match on just about anything you could dream of by using more complex regular expressions. Here's a quick cheat sheet âˆ’
#Following table lists the regular expression syntax that is available in Python.

#Focus on diffrence between .*? | .* 
#When using match operator focus on isg in the end..Why it is used?? and practise with examples..

#Now we will discuss on how to use regex aka regular expressions

#While going through these things also go through perl special variables like $_, $^O, $- and so on..Link to this is 
#https://www.tutorialspoint.com/perl/perl_special_variables.htm

my $pan = 'awert1234q';
$pan = uc($pan);
print "$pan\n";
#Similarly check out for lower case (lc)..

print "ERROR: PAN is invalid\n" if ($pan !~ /^\s*[a-z]{5}\d{4}[a-z]{1}\s*$/i);
#First we assign a value to PAN(Permanent Account Number). Then we can use validation check to see if PAN is valid or not..
#We have introduced few regex (Regular Expressions) while doing it..Identify each of them and understand there functionality.
#Also come up with examples with more regex usage.


my $str = "How do you do do do??";

my @do_count = $str =~ /do/isg;

print @do_count."\n";

#Above example gives you number of count of a letter..Practise few of them on your own to get hold of regex concepts.
#If you have gone through step wise you will know the use of strings, arrays used above..You can try the same using split function..DIY
#(Do it Yourself) exercise.


$str = "Check Number is 1234567 and count some random number is 89";

if ($str =~ /^.*?\s+(\d{4,7})\s+.*?(\d{2})\s*$/) {
    my $cheque_num = $1;
    print $cheque_num."\n";
}

#Above is an example where for number regex can be applied..
#We have used one of perl special variable above $1 which stores the data..Similarly you can use from $1..$9
#Explore few more examples on your own and add them here with regex.
